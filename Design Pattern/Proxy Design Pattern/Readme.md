The main use of this comes when an interviewer asks for any usecase like - 

- Centralized authentication & authorization – control access before calling the real service.
- Centralized caching – reduce redundant calls to the real service.
- Centralized request pre-processing and response post-processing – apply transformations, logging, or validations.
