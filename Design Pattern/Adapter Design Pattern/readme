### Main Gist - 

The Adapter pattern is especially useful when:

You already have an existing class with valuable functionality.

Its interface doesn’t match what your new code/client expects.

You don’t want to (or cannot) modify the original class (maybe it’s legacy, third-party, or closed-source).

So, you write a wrapper (adapter) that translates between the expected interface and the existing functionality.
