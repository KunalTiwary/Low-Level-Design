# The main part -

- The implementation of this pattern is exactly same as Strategy pattern.
- Bridge Pattern - Separate abstraction (what the object does) from implementation (how it does it), so both can evolve independently.
- Strategy Pattern - Define a family of interchangeable algorithms and let the client pick which one to use at runtime.

Bridge Pattern's is mostly used in case we want to create more shapes and colors (from our example which is coded) independently but strategy is used when we want to color the shapes dynamically at runtime.
