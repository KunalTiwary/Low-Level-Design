The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that defines an interface or method for creating objects, but lets subclasses or implementing classes decide which specific type of object to instantiate, rather than instantiating objects directly with a constructor. Basically the objects will be created based upon some custom logic which will be there in the factory class.
