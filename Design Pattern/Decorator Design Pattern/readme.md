# The main Gist - 

- The Decorator Pattern allows you to add new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure (i.e., without modifying its class).
- Adds features to objects one at a time, not to the entire class.
- Saves the code from Class explosion because if we implement the same logic without this pattern, the whole code will burst with the number of classes. Then, for each combination we have to create one one class like ExtraCheese(FarmHouse), Mushroom(ExtraCheese(FarmHouse)) and many more.
