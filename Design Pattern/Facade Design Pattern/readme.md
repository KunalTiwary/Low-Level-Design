# Main Gist-
It provides a simplified interface to a set of complex subsystems, making it easier for clients to interact with them without worrying about the details.

Without facade â†’ 
1. Client has to deal with multiple classes and their complex interactions.
2. If any new logic is changed/added/deleted, the client has to change its flow

We can create multiple sub-facades and use it, this is simplify the code even further

## Diff between facade and proxy -
- Proxy can create the object of only one class
- Proxy is an implementation of the same abstract class

## Diff between facade and adapter - 
- Adapter pattern is used when the client and adaptee is incompatible whereas
- facade is used to hide the complexity
